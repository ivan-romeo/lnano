Lnano is a Text editor written in C to play and to learn basic things.



# Narrative
I used to like coding in C, it was the first programming language I approached to. 
However when i started to study others languages at school i stopped to use it
and when i started to work as a web developer i completely abbandoned the use of it.
Some time ago i found the Antirez's repo Kilo and i said "Yes i would like to try to make
my version as a challenge and having fun" i estime Salvatore Sanfilippo and his content is ispiring for me.

I'm using Vim to develop it in order to improve my skill with this.
